From its debut through the most current tour, the mission of WaterWheel’s Touring 									Division has been to raise funds for pre-selected non-profits in each community that Phish visits while on tour.\n\nIn essence, WaterWheel is the Phish community coming together 								to share in positive ways with the local communities we all visit on tour stops. The net proceeds raised at each show – fan donations plus the sale of WaterWheel logo 												merchandise and items autographed by the band – are donated to the organization tabling at the show, after deducting overhead costs.\n\nThe WaterWheel Foundation chooses non-										profits from a large sphere of needs including social services, primarily those benefitting women and children; environmental, with a focus on clean water and land conservation 									with public access; as well as food banks, urban gardening and the like. Thanks to the generosity of the fans, since its creation WaterWheel’s Touring Division has donated over 									$1,000,000 to more than 425 groups.",
