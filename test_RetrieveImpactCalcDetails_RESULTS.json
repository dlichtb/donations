We’re hoping to make life just a little bit easier for them and their families. We’re looking to do this in two ways:\n\n-Provide a space for sensory sensitive kids to engage in community and enrichment opportunities with their peers in a sensory supported environment.\n\n-Create a website with information about sensory inputs and supports in public environments","street1":"4923 W Balmoral Ave.","street2":"","city":"Chicago","region":"IL","postal_code":"60630","country":"US","lat":"41.9787156","lon":"-87.7515473","website_url":"https://twentyonesenses.org/","profile_url":"https://www.pledgeling.com/organizations/83-2832419/Twenty-One-Senses","logo_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/pledgeling/w_266%2Ch_266%2Cc_fit/prod-media/images%2Fnpos%2Flogos%2F2019%2F8%2F30%2F39ee727e03009ef1.png"},{"id":"f3a124fb-6f4d-43f4-8508-9da9ccbcaf62","name":"Bal Asha Trust","alias":"","ngo_id":"30-0108263-1259","mission":"\"Bal Asha Trust believes every vulnerable child has the right to a brighter tomorrow.\n\nOur charitable organization advocates for the emotional and physical safety of children uprooted by destitution. \n\nWe provide children with access to a safe home, nutrition, quality medical care, education, recreation and rehabilitation. \n\nBal Asha also places children in stable family environments by reuniting them with lost relatives or finding loving families through legal adoption. \n\nWe aim to ensure the development of children through special programs such as education sponsorship and developmental centres for disable children. \n\nAdditionally, our dedicated team of professionals strives to spread local and global awareness of the many challenges faced by these children and their families. \n\nAbove all, we believe in empowering children with hope and better future to each child in need of care and protection.\"","street1":"Bal Asha Trust, Anand Niketan KGVM, Rakhangi Chowk, Dr. E.
